building the various song books and HTML indexes.

# About the Open Hymnal Project

From the website:

The aim of Open Hymnal Project to create a freely distributable, downloadable
database of Christian hymns, spiritual songs, and prelude/postlude music. I am
doing my best to create a final product that is "Hymnal-quality", and could
feasibly be used as the basis for a printed church hymnal. This music is to be
distributed as complete scores (words and music), using all accompaniment
parts, in formats that are easily accessible on most computer OS's and which
can be freely modified by anyone.

"Freely you received, so freely give." - Matthew 10:8 (WEB)
