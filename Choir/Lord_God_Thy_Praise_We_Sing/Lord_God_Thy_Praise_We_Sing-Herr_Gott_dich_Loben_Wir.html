<h3>Lord God, Thy Praise We Sing - Te Deum Laudamus</h3>
<p>
 Lord God, Thy praise we sing; Lord God, our thanks we bring; <br/>
 Father in eternity, All the world worships Thee. <br/>
 Angels all and heav'nly host Of Thy glory loudly boast;  <br/>
 Both Cherubim and Seraphim  Sing ever with loud voice this hymn:  <br/>
 Holy art Thou, our God! Holy art Thou, our God!  <br/>
 Holy art Thou, our God, the Lord of Sabaoth!  <br/>
 Thy majesty and godly might Fill the earth and all the realms of light.  <br/>
 The twelve apostles join in song With the dear prophets' goodly throng  <br/>
 The martyrs' noble army raise Their voice to Thee in hymns of praise.  <br/>
 The universal Church doth Thee Throughout the world confess to be <br/>
 Thee, Father, on Thy highest throne, Thy worthy, true, and well belov'd Son,  <br/>
 The Comforter, ev'n the Holy Ghost, Whereof she makes her constant boast.  <br/>
 Thee King of all glory, Christ, we own, Th'eternal Father's eternal Son.  <br/>
 To save mankind Thou hast not, Lord, The Virgin Mary's womb abhorred;  <br/>
 Thou over camest death's sharp sting, Believers unto heav'n to bring;  <br/>
 At God's right hand Thou sittest, clad In th'glory with the Father had;  <br/>
 Thou shalt in glory come again, To judge both dead and living men. <br/>
 Thy servants help whom Thou, O God, Hast ransomed with that precious blood;  <br/>
 Grant that we share the heav'nly rest With the happy saints eternally blest.  <br/>
 Help us, O Lord, from age to age, And bless Thy chosen heritage.  <br/>
 Nourish and keep them by Thy pow'r, And lift them up for evermore.  <br/>
 Lord God, we praise Thee day by day, And sanctify Thy Name always. <br/>
 Keep us this day, and at all times, From secret sins and open crimes; <br/>
 For mercy only, Lord, we plead; Be merciful to our great need.<br/>
 Show us Thy mercy, Lord, as we Our steadfast trust repose in Thee.<br/>
 In Thee, Lord, have we put our trust; O never let our hope be lost! Amen. Amen.
